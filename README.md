# Readability Score
Readability Score project in Java. From JetBrains Academy (hyperskill.org).

### About
Everyone has their own personal reading history, and as we grow up, we are able to comprehend more and more complicated
texts. But how do you estimate the level of difficulty of a given text, and how do you teach a computer to do that? In
this project, you will find it out: write a program that determines how difficult the text is and for which age it is
most suitable.

##### Stage 1: Simplest estimation
Starting off simple, write a program that reads an input from System.in, then determines if it's easy or hard to read.
The criteria at this stage is, well, simple. If the input contains 100 symbols (including whitespace and punctuation) or
less, then it is easy. Otherwise, we'll consider it hard.

##### Stage 2: Words and sentences
Time to take another approach. We'll now base our decision on the average numbers of words in each sentence.

Read from System.in a single line of text containing sentences. Calculate the average number of words per sentence, and
output `EASY` if the average is 10 or lower. Otherwise, output `HARD`.

##### Stage 3: Score!
Build upon the previous stage and read the text in from a file supplied via a command-line argument. We will now compute
a score using the Automated readability index
([Wikipedia article here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_readability_index)).

Calculate and output the following: number of words in the text, number of sentences, number of characters, the ARI
score, and the age range needed to comprehend the text.

##### Stage 4: More parameters
Implement three more readability score algorithms: Fleschâ€“Kincaid, SMOG, and Coleman-Liau. Also calculate the number of
syllables and polysyllables (words with 3 or more syllables) in the text - needed for the other indexes calculations.

After outputting the counts of everything, ask which index score is to be calculated (or all), output requested index(s)
and then the (average) age of the index(s).
